# YouTube Clone

This project is a YouTube clone that allows users to search for and watch videos, as well as interact with other users through commenting and live chatting. It provided me a hands-on experience for building complex applications with React and other modern web development technologies. Some of the main features of this application include a highly optimized search bar with suggestions, n-level nested comments, and live chatting functionality using API polling.

## Features

### Highly Optimized Search Bar with Suggestions

The search bar in this YouTube clone is highly optimized to provide quick and efficient search results to users. It includes a suggestion feature that predicts and displays potential search queries, helping users to find videos quickly and easily. Additionally, the search bar is equipped with debouncing and caching capabilities, which improve the performance of the search functionality by minimizing unnecessary API calls.

### N-level Nested Comments

Another significant feature of this YouTube clone is the ability to create n-level nested comments. This feature adds depth to the user engagement by allowing users to reply to specific comments and create threaded discussions. With the n-level nested comments feature, users can easily follow and contribute to conversations related to the video content.

### Live Chatting Functionality using API Polling

The live chatting functionality in this YouTube clone is designed to enhance the overall user experience by allowing users to communicate with each other in real-time. The application uses API polling to retrieve and display chat messages, ensuring that users can stay up-to-date with the latest conversations. The live chatting functionality is integrated seamlessly into the application, and users can easily switch between watching videos and participating in live chats.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- React
- React Router DOM
- Redux
- Tailwind CSS
- Create React App

### React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is a popular choice for building single-page applications and was used in this project for its simplicity and efficiency in creating reusable components.

### React Router DOM

React Router DOM is a routing library for handling client-side routing in React applications. It was used in this project to enable users to navigate between different sections of the YouTube clone application.

### Redux

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It was used in this project to manage global application state and simplify data flow between different components.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style web applications with pre-defined classes. It was used in this project to quickly and efficiently style components and provide a consistent look and feel across the application.

### Create React App

Create React App is a tool for creating React applications with no build configuration. It was used in this project to quickly set up the development environment and provide a solid foundation for building the application. It includes useful tools such as Webpack, Babel, and other dependencies which allow us to start building our application right away instead of spending time on initial setup.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need the following software installed on your local machine:

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

To install the app's dependencies, simply run the following command in the project directory:
`npm install`

## Usage

To start the app, run the following command in the project directory:
`npm start`

Once the development server is running, you can open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app. From there, you can interact with the app's various features and functionalities.

If you want to build the app for production, you can run the following command in the project directory:
`npm run build`

This will create an optimized production build of the app in the `build` directory. You can then deploy this build to a hosting platform of your choice.
